          <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
          <p>
            The <Link to="/leaderboard">leaderboard</Link> ranks users by their
            average number of guesses taken to solve Wordles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users must solve at least three Wordles over the given time period
            to earn a place on the leaderboard
          </p>
          <p>
            Users achieve a "hot streak" (denoted by ðŸ”¥) after successfuly
            completing three consecutive Wordles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skipping a puzzle snaps a streak, as does failing to solve the
            puzzle altogether.
