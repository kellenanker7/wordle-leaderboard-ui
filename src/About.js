          <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
          <p>
            The <Link to="/leaderboard">leaderboard</Link> ranks users by their
            average number of guesses taken to solve Wordles. Users must solve
            at least three Wordles over the given time period to earn a place on
            the leaderboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users achieve a "hot streak" (ðŸ”¥) after successfuly completing three
            consecutive Wordles. Skipping a Wordle snaps a streak, as does
            failing to solve a Wordle.
